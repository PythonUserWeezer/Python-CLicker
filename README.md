# Python-Clicker
This Is a python clicker that has multiple different ways to click, using keys or mouse clicks, customizeable toggle/stop key, and even a seconds and click counter to show how much youve clicked (PS.  the seconds do slow down at faster speeds, also dont set the delay to -1)


# Please do not bug me about any issues this is a single application if you want to bug me about anything, bug me about suggestions, my discord username is stickyrespawnthegoat if you want to contact me, if you dont have discord then fuck off.
